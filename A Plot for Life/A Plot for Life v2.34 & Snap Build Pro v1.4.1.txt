*** Install Instructions ***


Copy the custom folder to you mpmissions/[map] folder.

Create a custom folder in the server root directory (the one you have the @mod files in) and copy the contents of the Server folder in to it (you can merge them in to the dayz_server.pbo but need to change the references).



*** Instructions for linking in to your mission (after the files are installed). ***

 
Open your mpmissions/[map]/init.sqf file (where [map] is the map you are installing for, i.e. DayZ_Epoch_11.Chernarus)

 
Search for
call compile preprocessFileLineNumbers "\z\addons\dayz_code\init\variables.sqf";

Replace with
call compile preprocessFileLineNumbers "Custom\A_Plot_for_Life\init\variables.sqf";


Search for
call compile preprocessFileLineNumbers "\z\addons\dayz_code\init\publicEH.sqf";

Replace with
call compile preprocessFileLineNumbers "Custom\A_Plot_for_Life\init\publicEH.sqf";


Search for
call compile preprocessFileLineNumbers "\z\addons\dayz_code\init\compiles.sqf";

Replace with
call compile preprocessFileLineNumbers "Custom\A_Plot_for_Life\init\compiles.sqf";


Search for
_serverMonitor = [] execVM "\z\addons\dayz_code\system\server_monitor.sqf";
Replace with (you may need to change this depending on where you put the server files).
_serverMonitor = [] execVM "custom\system\server_monitor.sqf";


Add the following line to the bottom of your description.ext located in your MPMissions\[Map] folder
#include "custom\snap_pro\snappoints.hpp"
